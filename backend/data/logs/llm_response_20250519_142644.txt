Okay, let's break down the user's question. The current query is "Một căn chung cư 76 mét vuông thì làm nội thất khoảng bao nhiêu tiền?" which translates to asking about the cost of interior design for a 76m² apartment. 

First, I need to check if this relates to any specific department. The user mentioned "nội thất" (interior design), which might relate to the "Thiết kế" (Design) department. However, the question is about cost estimation, not the design process itself. 

Looking at the list of departments provided: 2D, Dự toán, Kinh doanh, Kế toán, Marketing, Mua hàng, Team dự án, Thi công, Thiết kế, Đặt hàng. The "Dự toán" department deals with budgeting or cost estimation. So maybe the user is asking about the budget for interior design, which would fall under "Dự toán".
