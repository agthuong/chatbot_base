Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking "team IT tham gia dự án nào không". First, I need to check if "team IT" is a department in the provided list. The list includes 2D, Dự toán, Kinh doanh, Kế toán, Marketing, Mua hàng, Team dự án, Thi công, Thiết kế, Đặt hàng. "Team IT" isn't explicitly listed here. The closest might be "Team dự án", but that's different from "team IT". 

Next, according to rule 8, if the department mentioned isn't in the list, it should be considered general. So since "team IT" isn't a valid department here, the department field should be null. Then, the query type would be general because the question is about what projects the IT team is involved in, which might not be specific to any listed department. Also, there's no mention of a previous context,
