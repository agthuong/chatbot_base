Okay, let me try to figure out how to respond to the user's question. The user asked, "vậy khi nào team IT tham gia dự án," which translates to "When does the IT team join the project?" 

First, I need to check if this is a valid question about the workflow or stages. According to the rules provided, I should only address questions related to processes, departments, and their tasks. The user's question is about when the IT team joins a project, which seems relevant.

But wait, looking at the list of departments provided: 2D, Dự toán, Khách hàng, Kinh doanh, Kế toán, Marketing, Mua hàng, Team dự án, Thi công, Thiết kế, Đặt hàng. There's no mention of an IT department. The user might have a typo or misunderstanding. Maybe they meant "Team dự án" (Project Team) instead of "IT team"? Or perhaps the IT department isn't listed here.

Since the user is asking about the IT team, but according to the given departments, there's no IT department. So I need to inform them that the question is not applicable because the IT team isn't part of the listed departments. However, the user might have intended another department. 

But according to the rules, if the question is unrelated to work, I should respond humorously with emojis. But in this case, the question is about a department not listed. So maybe it's a valid question but the IT team isn't part of the company structure here. Therefore, I need to clarify that there's no IT department and suggest checking other departments. However, the rules say if the question is unrelated, respond with humor. But this is related but about a non-existent department.

Wait, the user might have made a mistake. The correct response would be to point out that "IT team" isn't listed among the departments. So I should answer that there's no IT team in the provided list and suggest checking other departments. However, the rules say if the question is unrelated, respond with humor. But this is related but about a non-existent department. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the user meant "Team dự án" (Project Team) instead of IT. But without more context, I can't assume that. So the safest way is to state that the IT team isn't part of the listed departments and suggest asking about other departments. Then end with the required suggestion.
