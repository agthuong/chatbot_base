Okay, let's see. The user provided a question that's supposed to be about the company's process stages and departments. But their initial response was a bit off, so they want me to correct it.

First, I need to make sure I follow the rules strictly. The user mentioned not to create any links between departments and stages, just describe the stages and list the responsible departments. Also, end with the suggested prompt about asking specific departments.

The original answer given by the assistant was a bit too detailed and included explanations of what each department does, which violates the rule. So I need to make it concise, only listing the stages and the departments involved without any explanation.

Wait, the user's example response starts with "D∆∞·ªõi ƒë√¢y l√† c·∫•u tr√∫c quy tr√¨nh v√† giai ƒëo·∫°n..." then lists the stages and departments. But according to the rules, I shouldn't explain anything, just state the structure. So maybe the assistant should just list the stages and the departments without any additional text.

Also, the user wants the answer in Vietnamese, using Markdown. The example response uses bullet points for stages and departments. So I need to replicate that structure.

Another thing: if the question isn't related to work, respond humorously with emojis. But in this case, the user's question is about the process, so stick to the structure.

So the correct answer should be a list of the five stages, each followed by the departments responsible, without any explanations. Then end with the suggested prompt.
